** Dart Language and why its is important
    --XML requirement to develo UI
    --Java kotlin to backend development
    --Data connectivity for DBMS ---Simlar to API management

** Flutter is a single code based framework ,i.e here we use only one language for all things ,like logic building and event listening ---> which is Dart

--We learn dart for flutter development ,becous eits increase the speed to learn flutter development
**WHat is Dart?
   --Launch is 2011,developed by google

   --A mixture of JavaScript and Java
   -- Fouces on frontend(mobile .web,apps)

**Benefits of Dart
.Use of async and await for asynchronus programming
.Dart is one of very few langauge (and perhaps the only "mainstream"language )that is well suited to being compiled both AOT(ahead-of-time) & JIT(just in time).
support both kinds of compilation provides significans advantages to dart and (especailly)Flutter (Hot Reloading Feature)
.JIT compilation is used during development ,using a compiler that is especially sat,THen when an app is ready for release it it compiled AOT.
.Extremeely fast development cyvles and sast execution and startup times
dart can be compiled into JavaScriptso it can be executed in browser
.
Flutter doesent split layour btw your program and an templating or layuot langauge like jsx or XML ,a
